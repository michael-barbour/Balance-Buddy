# Balance-Buddy
Chemical Balancer created for android devices.

Balance Buddy is an android app that I made in college as one of my capstone courses.  The app is a multifunction tool that will perform conversions between several different measurements, both in the metric and imperial systems, balance deterministic chemical equations, and preform gas law balancing.

The calculations are done by custom made classes located in BalanceBuddy>app>src>main>java.

The application was created in Android Studio.
